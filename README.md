# Simple_Static_WebApp
First static simple webApp created during my first year in Bachelors to try hands-on web development locally. 
Technologies used: HTML, CSS

To run it:
----------
Note that this app is static and its designed to run locally using a simple HTTP server such as 'python simple http server'.

1. Git clone or download the codebase from github repository.
2. Navigate to 'code' folder using command prompt on windows or terminal on mac.
3. Run the python command 'python -m http.server 8080' from inside the 'code' folder from your terminal.
4. Thats it, kudos! You have started a web server using your machine as the host.
5. To view it in action, open a web browser(such as chrome, safari, etc,.) of your choice and paste http://localhosthttp:8080/ (or) http://0.0.0.0:8080/ on the browser search bar.
6. Home page is named as 'css.html' in the code folder.
